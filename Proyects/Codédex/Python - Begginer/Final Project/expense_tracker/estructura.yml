Run the main.py file, and introduce your expenses. This project would improve, I promise 😊




Steps to structure the expense controller:
    Data collection 2.
        - User input (title/description of expense, category of expense, amount and date)
        - Verification of entries

    example:
    {
    “category": ”grocery”
    “title": ”Pizza dinner”
    “quantity": 30.00
    “date": ”2025-04-25”
    }
        
    2. Data structure
        - Dictionary to store the expenses, the keys are the categories (food, housing...) and the values of the lists are the corresponding quantities.
    
    3. Calculations and analysis (with filters)
      - Total sum: calculate the total expense per category and in total.
      - Budget: the user can define a maximum budget per category and show if it is within the limit or not.
      - Average spending: calculate the average spending per category.

    4. Results display
      - Display results: show total spent per category, total spend and compare with budget
      - Use graphs (matplotlib)

    5. Save and load data
